CARECONNECT PROTOTYPE

FORMAT
Semester-long individual class project

ROLES
Interaction Designer

THE CHALLENGE
Create a solution to connect the community of caregivers. Brainstorm, wireframe, and prototype a solution, then perform several iterations after user testing.

ALTERNATIVES
After considering the problem space in depth, I sketched several possible solutions. I created a storyboard for each potential solution, and I settled on an app-based approach after considering each idea’s workflow and feasibility.

PERSONAS
To best address the problem, I created three personas representative of my potential users as well as an anti-persona. By empathizing with my users, I was able to identify their pain points and determine which goals were crucial to my system’s success.

PROTOTYPING
I began to draft my solution, beginning with paper prototyping. Pictured is my second draft, which incorporates feedback from potential users.

DIGITAL PROTOTYPE
After testing my revised paper prototype again with peers and a caregiver, I created my digital prototype. Based on my personas, I identified the need for a tailored experience within the app. My users would receive the most benefit from being able to meet other caregivers facing similar challenges, so I gave users the option to input information about their individual situations during account setup. To build community, I provided users with the flexibility to search for groups by mile radius. I also streamlined the account setup process and incorporated a tutorial after considering user feedback.

See below for a few screenshots of my digital prototype. You can view the full prototype here:

DISCUSSION
While I was able to incorporate some user feedback, my pool of users was limited due to time constraints. I gleaned several pieces of crucial information from my user testing sessions and hope to incorporate more thorough testing into future projects.

One main takeaway from this piece was that iteration is the key to good design. My first prototype was missing several interactions that were fundamental to my final prototype’s success. Through multiple rounds of sketching and revision, I was able to weed out major design flaws and streamline the interface of my project.

Final thoughts: Feedback is a gift. While my peers and I were hesitant at first to share our honest critiques, their perspectives helped me to refine my work enough to focus on the small details. Positive feedback was just as important as constructive criticism. Seeing my users complete some interactions with no problems showed me which components would be central to the project’s success. When my users didn’t notice the design decisions at all, I knew that these decisions had been effective.
